## Request

Go wild with pull requests in a standardized layout and share for more contributions

Don't worry too much about the id value; they can be renumerated if needed later on

## TODO

This XML can be split out into different domains - whoever makes the decision gets to document that decision in a pull request

I have a few extra entries on a laptop somewhere (that I hopefully did not destroy in a OS reinstall)
